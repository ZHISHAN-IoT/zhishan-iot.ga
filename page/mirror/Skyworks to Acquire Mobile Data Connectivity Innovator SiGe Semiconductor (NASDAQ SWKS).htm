    <h1>Skyworks to Acquire Mobile Data Connectivity Innovator SiGe Semiconductor</h1>
      
    <h2>Accelerates Ascent to Wireless Networking Leadership; Immediately Accretive</h2> 
    
      <div id="ndq-releasebody"><p>WOBURN, Mass. &amp; ANDOVER, Mass., May 17, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) --</p><p>Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: SWKS), an innovator of high 
      reliability analog and mixed signal semiconductors enabling a broad 
      range of end markets, today signed a definitive agreement to purchase 
      SiGe Semiconductor, Inc., a leading global supplier of radio frequency 
      (RF) front-end solutions that are facilitating wireless multimedia 
      across a wide range of applications. The acquisition of SiGe, a fabless 
      semiconductor provider, complements Skyworks' leadership in wide area 
      front-end solutions by adding SiGe's innovative short range, 
      silicon-based products. As a result, Skyworks will be able to offer 
      customers a comprehensive wireless networking product portfolio, 
      supporting all key operating frequencies with architectural flexibility 
      to address a variety of high growth applications. Specifically, via this 
      transaction, Skyworks immediately expands its addressable content 
      opportunity within several strategic product areas including smart 
      phones, tablets, gaming consoles, notebook PCs and home automation 
      systems.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Skyworks' acquisition of SiGe Semiconductor underscores our commitment 
      to capitalize on ubiquitous wireless connectivity," said David J. 
      Aldrich, president and chief executive officer of Skyworks. "To that 
      end, this acquisition is highly complementary in terms of our addressed 
      markets, sales channels, process technologies, design methodologies and 
      baseband partnerships. At the same time, the SiGe business presents 
      significant operational and cost synergies yielding immediate earnings 
      accretion and long-term shareholder value creation."
</p>
<p>"Skyworks clearly represents the best strategic and cultural fit for 
      SiGe Semiconductor," said Sohail Khan, president and chief executive 
      officer of SiGe Semiconductor. "Both companies have a long history of 
      front-end innovation and a shared vision of the future of band-intensive 
      wireless networking. Together, we can develop and deliver products of 
      unprecedented integration and improve our customers' performance in the 
      increasingly connected wireless world."
</p>
<p>Skyworks will pay $210 million in cash, plus an additional $65 million 
      if certain performance targets are met over the next 12 months. The 
      transaction has been approved by Skyworks' and SiGe's boards of 
      directors and is anticipated to close in June, subject to customary 
      closing conditions, including the receipt of domestic and foreign 
      regulatory approvals. Excluding any non-recurring acquisition related 
      charges and amortization of acquired intangibles, Skyworks expects the 
      acquisition to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings and will 
      finalize estimates of the transaction's financial impact, as well as the 
      accounting for the transaction, upon deal close.
</p>
<p>SiGe Semiconductor's diverse and comprehensive product portfolio 
      provides the performance, range and reliability required by 
      802.11b/g/a/n, Bluetooth<font size="-1"><sup>®</sup></font>, WiMAX, GPS and ZigBee<font size="-1"><sup>®</sup></font> Systems. The company's 
      innovative utilization of silicon-based semiconductor technologies 
      simplifies the integration of RF signal processing for many of today's 
      leading consumer, commercial and industrial electronics companies. Key 
      SiGe customers include Cisco, Dell, Huawei, Hewlett-Packard, NetGear, 
      Itron, Microsoft, Nintendo, Samsung and Sony.

      evolving industry standards, and to identify opportunities in new 
      markets; uncertainties of litigation, including potential disputes over 
      intellectual property infringement and rights, as well as payments 
      related to the licensing and/or sale of such rights; our ability to 
      rapidly develop new products and avoid product obsolescence; our ability 
      to retain, recruit and hire key executives, technical personnel and

      impact the timing of new product introductions; unfavorable changes in 
      product mix; the quality of our products and any remediation costs; 
      shorter than expected product life cycles; problems or delays that we 
      may face in shifting our products to smaller geometry process 
      technologies and in achieving higher levels of design integration; and 
      our ability to continue to grow and maintain an intellectual property 
      portfolio and obtain needed licenses from third parties, as well as 
      other risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those
